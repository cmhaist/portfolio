    <p>My biggest inspiration is fantasy. I thoroughly enjoy fantasy novels, videogames, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The most recent fantasy novel I finished reading is called Geist, a story about powerful, ecclesiastical magicians who strive to protect the world from demonic influence. I've enjoyed an unhealthy amount of videogames, including single player titles such as The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Dragon Age, and Divinity; and have invested an unfathomable number of hours in massive multiplayer online roleplaying games (MMORPGs) including titles such as Guild Wars 2, TERA, Runescape, and the Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
    
    <p>I do not enjoy cartoons or anime, but I was heavily influenced by the television series Yu-Gi-Oh! when I was younger. The main protagonist, a charismatic youth armed with his deck of cards, made for a popular role model. I was fascinated by the wide variety of fantasy trading cards, and still am today, though I have little time or money to invest in collecting and maintinaing a functional deck. Reading about current meta builds and reading about new cards is enough to keep me interested; it's fascinating to see how game has evolved over the years, and with it the art and designs. Designing cards for a fantasy trading card game would be a great opportunity to merge my skills with one of my sources of inspiration.</p>
